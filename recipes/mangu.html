        <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Mangú is the most beloved Dominican breakfast dish. It consists of boiled green plantains mashed with butter and water until smooth. It is traditionally topped with sautéed red onions marinated in vinegar. When served with fried salami, fried cheese, and fried eggs, the dish is famously known as "Los Tres Golpes" (The Three Hits).
