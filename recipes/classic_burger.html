    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic burger consist of a juicy, seasoned beef patty grilled to perfection, 
    sandwiched between two soft, toasted buns. It is typically dressed with fresh lettuce, 
    a slice of ripe tomato, and crisp onions, topped with a tangy slice of melted cheese. 
    A dollop of ketchup and mustard adds just the right kick, <strong>making this classic burger a 
    go-to comfort meal for any occasion</strong>. For an extra layer of flavor, pickles can be added for 
    a zesty crunch, while a side of golden, crispy fries perfectly complements the burger's savory 
    goodness. Simple yet satisfying, this timeless favorite never goes out of style.
